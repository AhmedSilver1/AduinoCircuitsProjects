## Overview   

This repository documents my learning process in implementing Arduino circuits, using digital and physical circuits to implement seneors and output components.



## Getting Started with Arduino Components

### Arduino UNO R3
![s-l400](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6ede363-3aba-4aaa-9eda-269f558c0df2)

Arduino is a microcontroller board that reads inputs like a push of a button or light on a senors, and turn it into an output like turning on an LED.([What is Arduino?](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/starting-guide/whats-arduino/) )

### Digital Pins
![Arduino-Uno-Pinout-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ab2d359-c7ed-4729-a779-0136e3759959)
Pins in Arduino can be configured as either input or output. It has 14 digital input/output pins, 6 of them can be usd as PWM output. Digital pins have two distinct values: HIGH(1) or LOW(0). You can cahnge the state of pins to achive the desired input or output. Changing the value of the pin can be done by using digitalWrtie(), or analogWrite(). ([Digital Pins
](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/microcontrollers/digital-pins/))

```
void setup() {
  // Set up pin 11 as an output
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
} // end of setup()
```
#### The difference between digitalWrite() and analogWrite() 
Digitalwrite() allow you to set the digital pin to HIGH or LOW only. While analogWtite() apply Pulse Width Modulation(PWM) to create an on-off pattern that can simulate voltages between 5v and 0v. This is done in 2miliseconds cycles where you can set the pin between 0 and 255 during the duty cycle. ([Basics of PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/microcontrollers/analog-output/))
```
//turn pin 12 on (high) using digitalWrite()
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN , HIGH);
// Set up pin 13 to 50% brightness using analogWrite()
  analogWrite(LED_PIN, 127); 
```

### Breadboard

Breadbaord are used to build prototypes of electronic circuits to test if it works or not. ([Breadboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadboard)) The breadboard is divided to three parts. The power rail, the ground rail, and the circuits area

### Resistor

Resistors work like a dam in a river. Just like a dam slows down the water flow, a resistor slows down the flow of electricity in a circuit. This helps make sure that the components only get the right amount of power, preventing them from getting too much. I used 220Ohm for the LED circuits.

### LED
Light Emitting Diode is mainly used to provide visual feedback in a ciruit. The LED have two legs Cathode(short leg), and Anode(long leg). The Cathode is the (-) where you connect it to the ground rail, while the anode is the (+) where you connect it to the circuits area.

### Wires

([Exploring Arduino](https://www.exploringarduino.com/parts/jumper-wires/))

Jumber wiers connect the arduino with the external  components and vice-versa.
## Tinkercad Simulator
All the digital circuits are made using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/). Tinkercad a is a free web app for 3D design, electronics, and coding.

## Electronics
This section talk about the concepts in electronic circuits that are realted to prototyping arduino circuits.
### Ohm`s Law
Ohm`s law till us the electric Current through a wire in  a ciruit. 
|Symbol  |Term      |Unit     |
|:------:|:--------:|:-------:|
| V      |Voltage   | Volts   |
|I       |Curttent  | Amperes |
|  R     |Resistor  | Ohms    |
