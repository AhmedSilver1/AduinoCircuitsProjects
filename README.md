## Overview   

This repository documents my learning process in implementing Arduino circuits, using digital and physical circuits to implement seneors and output components.



## Getting Started with Arduino Components

### Arduino UNO R3

Arduino is a microcontroller board that reads inputs like a push of a button or light on a senors, and turn it into an output like turning on an LED.([What is Arduino?](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/starting-guide/whats-arduino/) )

### Digital Pins

Pins in Arduino can be configured as either input or output. It has 14 digital input/output pins, 6 of them can be usd as PWM output. Digital pins have two distinct values: HIGH(1) or LOW(0). You can cahnge the state of pins to achive the desired input or output. Changing the value of the pin can be done by using digitalWrtie(), or analogWrite(). ([Digital Pins
](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/microcontrollers/digital-pins/))

#### The difference between digitalWrite() and analogWrite() 
Digitalwrite() allow you to set the digital pin to HIGH or LOW only. While analogWtite() apply Pulse Width Modulation(PWM) to create an on-off pattern that can simulate voltages between 5v and 0v. This is done in 2miliseconds cycles where you can set the pin between 0 and 255 during the duty cycle. ([Basics of PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
