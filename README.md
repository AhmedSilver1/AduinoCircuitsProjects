## Overview   

This repository documents my learning process in implementing Arduino circuits, using digital and physical components to control sensors and output devices.



## Getting Started with Arduino Components

### Arduino UNO R3
![s-l400](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6ede363-3aba-4aaa-9eda-269f558c0df2)

The Arduino is a microcontroller board that reads inputs, like pressing a button or detecting light from a sensor, and turns it into an output, like lighting up an LED. 

([What is Arduino?](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/starting-guide/whats-arduino/) )

### Digital Pins
![Arduino-Uno-Pinout-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ab2d359-c7ed-4729-a779-0136e3759959)
Digital pins on an Arduino can be configured as either input or output. There are 14 digital I/O pins, 6 of which can be used as PWM outputs. Digital pins can have two distinct values: HIGH (1) or LOW (0). You can change the pin state using `digitalWrite()` or `analogWrite()`.

([Digital Pins](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/microcontrollers/digital-pins/))

```
void setup() {
  // Set up pin 11 as an output
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
} // end of setup()
```
#### The difference between `digitalWrite()` and `analogWrite()` 
`digitalWrite()` sets the digital pin to either HIGH or LOW, while `analogWrite()` applies Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to simulate varying voltage levels (0-5V) by creating an on-off pattern. PWM cycles every 2 milliseconds, and the pin value can be set between 0 and 255 to control the output. 
([Basics of PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/microcontrollers/analog-output/))
```
//turn pin 12 on (high) using digitalWrite()
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN , HIGH);
// Set up pin 13 to 50% brightness using analogWrite()
  analogWrite(LED_PIN, 127); 
```

### Breadboard
![Breadboard-Pinout](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f240af38-34df-4cbc-9688-d69f349f4dd3)


Breadboards are used to build prototypes of electronic circuits and test whether they work. The breadboard has three key sections: the power rail, ground rail, and circuit area.

### Resistor

Resistors limit current flow in a circuit, much like a dam slows the flow of water. This prevents components like LEDs from receiving too much power. I used 220-ohm resistors in the LED circuits.

### LED
Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) provide visual feedback in a circuit. LEDs have two legs: the cathode (short leg, -) is connected to the ground rail, and the anode (long leg, +) is connected to the circuit area

### Wires

([Exploring Arduino](https://www.exploringarduino.com/parts/jumper-wires/))

Jumper wires connect the arduino with the external  components and vice-versa.
## Tinkercad Simulator
All the digital circuits are made using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/). Tinkercad is a free web app for 3D design, electronics, and coding.

## Electronics
This section discusses the concepts in electronic circuits that are realted to prototyping arduino circuits.
### Ohm`s Law
Ohm's law describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in a circuit.

|Symbol  |Term      |Unit     |
|:------:|:--------:|:-------:|
| V      |Voltage   | Volts   |
|I       |Current  | Amperes |
|  R     |Resistor  | Ohms    |

## Circuits
This section is about circuits implementations.
### On/Off LED Circuit
The objective of the circuit is to implement an on/off LED loop.

//with a one second delay

//Define pin 12 as a constant

  pinMode(LED_PIN , OUTPUT); 
}

void loop()

  // Wait for 1000 milliseconds (1 second)
  delay(1000);
  //turn pin 12 off(low)
  digitalWrite(12, LOW);
  //wait for 1000 milliseconds (1 second)
  delay(1000);

  for (int i = 0; i <= 255; i++) {
    // increment pin 11 value to increase brightness
    analogWrite(LED_PIN, i); 
    // Wait for 5 milliseconds before increasing brightness
    delay(5);
